  <h2 style ="text-align: center">A Billion Assignments</h2>
  <p style ="text-align: center">The inspiration for this poem is my overwhelming course load. I am always doing homework, so I figured I would dedicate this to that.</p>
  <p style ="text-align: center">Want to know schoolwork?<br>Understand the misery<br>Of working forever</p>

  <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
  <p>As I'm sure you noticed based on my haiku, I do not have a lot of time for my interests currently. Most of my day is spent either at school or working
    on school assingments. When I'm not doing one of those two things, I am either working, doing life maintenance activites, or sleeping. 
  </p>
  <p>With that said, I do strongly enjoy learning and my work. I currently work for a tax company, so I learn alot about researching and how taxes work. 
    I love money and money management so my job is right up my alley. I love budgeting, investment planning, and tracking my spending. 
  </p>
  <p>Luckily I do have some hobbies I do outside of work, school, and necessary upkeep. I enjoy reading random novels, playing video games, self care, and fashion.
    Most days I don't have work or school, I am found sleeping in late and having a chill day with not much activity. I am always up for going out and doing things
    but at my core I am definetely a homebody. 
  </p>
